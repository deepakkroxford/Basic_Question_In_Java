         * Given an integer N, write a program to find the oneâ€™s complement of the
         * integer.
         * 
         * 
         * Example 1:
         * 
         * Input:
         * N = 5
         * Output:
         * 2
         * Explanation:
         * binary of 5 is 101
         * 1's complement of 101 is 010
         * 010 is 2 in its decimal form.
         * Example 2:
         * 
         * Input:
         * N = 255
         * Output:
         * 0
         * Explanation:
         * binary of 255 is 1111 1111
         * 1's complement of 1111 1111 is
         * 0000 0000 which is 0 in its decimal form.

          we are doing bitmask leftshift by 1 and doing OR operation with 1;

          so 000000001
          m =4 becuse we are doing right shift on m so m =101 now its 10;
          so again 00000011 m= 1;
          so again 00000111 m =0;
          loop will break
